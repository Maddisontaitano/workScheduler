# workScheduler

work Scheduler!

in this assignment the goal was to make a work scheduler using JavaScript and HTML.

The assignment required the use of JS to save the items to local storage and have them print back out on the same hour line they were entered. 

I used a series of divs and labels to create my html time blocks. We were also required to have the time blocks colored depending on what hour we are in. Grey for the past hours, red for the current hour, and green for the future hours. 

I found the Java script very challenging in this. I kept having to change my html time block to get everything to function properly.
